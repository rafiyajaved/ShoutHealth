          <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Every year, hundreds of Atlanta residents fail to access primary healthcare, even when itâ€™s free. The biggest discrepancy is in marginalized populations- minorities and low-income families.
            Why? A major reason for this is a barrier to information.</p>
            <p>Our Goal: Decentralize information.</p>
            <p>We believe that the best way to achieve good healthcare among marginalized communities is to empower them to inform themselves and each other.</p>
        </Paper>
